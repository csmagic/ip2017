#+OPTIONS: toc:nil
* Install prerequisites
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
$ sudo apt-get install gcc build-essential git emacs
#+END_SRC
* Clone gofer
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
$ git clone https://github.com/rusimody/gofer.git
#+END_SRC
* Build

Above should make a directory called gofer Usually in your home but that depends on where you ran the git clone

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
cd gofer/src # Or wherever you have put it
$ make
#+END_SRC

* Check executable

Above should make an executable called gofer. When you run it (at shell as:)
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
$ ./gofer
#+END_SRC
you should get an error that prelude not found

Set the path thus at shell (make sure the path below is correct!)
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
$ export PUGOFER=/home/[yourname]/gofer/pusimple.pre
#+END_SRC
Now gofer should run (at shell) ie
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
$ ./gofer
#+END_SRC
should start

* Emacs Setup
** Directory setup

Make a directory called elisp in ~/.emacs.d
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
$ cd ~/.emacs.d
$ mkdir elisp
#+END_SRC
** Copy contents

   Copy the files pugofer-init.el and pugofer.el into this elisp directory
** Init setup

Add this line to end of =~/.emacs.d/init.el=

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "~/.emacs.d/elisp"))
#+END_SRC
** Change paths

Look for =setenv= calls in =pugofer-init.el=
Change these to your paths
Copy this whole file to bottom of =~/.emacs.d/init.el=
